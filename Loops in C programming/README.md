# Different types of loop in C program

## for loop:
   * This loop has a fixed number of iterations, which are specified by an initialization, a test, and an update expression.
   * For example:
     ```
           // print numbers from 1 to 10
      for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
          printf("%d\n", i);
      }
     ```
