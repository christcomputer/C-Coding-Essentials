Sure, let's add information about `struct`:

**1. Struct in C++**
A `struct` (short for structure) in C++ is a user-defined data type that allows you to combine data items of different kinds. Structures are used to represent a record. Here's an example:
```cpp
struct Student {
   string name;
   int roll_no;
};
```
In this example, `Student` is a `struct` that has two members: `name` (a string) and `roll_no` (an integer).

**2. Pointer in C++**
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. For example:
```cpp
int var = 50;  
int *p;  
p = &var;  
```
In this example, `var` is a variable and `p` is a pointer. We assign the address of `var` to `p` using `&` (address of) operator.

**3. Arrow Operator in C++**
The arrow operator `->` in C++ is used to access members of a structure or a union using a pointer. For example:
```cpp
struct demo {
   int x = 10;
};

int main() {
   demo *ptr = new demo();
   cout << ptr->x;
   return 0;
}
```
In this example, `ptr` is a pointer to a structure `demo`. We access the member `x` of `demo` using the arrow operator `->`.

**4. Dot Operator in C++**
The dot operator `.` is used to access the members of a structure or a union directly. For example:
```cpp
struct demo {
   int x = 10;
};

int main() {
   demo obj;
   cout << obj.x;
   return 0;
}
```
In this example, `obj` is an object of structure `demo`. We access the member `x` of `demo` using the dot operator `.`.

**5. Linked List in C++**
A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links. Here is a simple example of a linked list:
```cpp
struct Node {
   int data;
   struct Node *next;
};

int main() {
   Node* head = NULL;
   Node* second = NULL;
   Node* third = NULL;
   
   // allocate 3 nodes in the heap  
   head = new Node();
   second = new Node();
   third = new Node();
   
   head->data = 1; //assign data in first node
   head->next = second; // Link first node with second
   
   second->data = 2; //assign data to second node
   second->next = third;
   
   third->data = 3; //assign data to third node
   third->next = NULL;
   
   return 0;
}
```
In this example, we created a simple linked list with three nodes. Each node has a data part and an address part that points to the next node. The `head` node points to the start of the linked list, and the last element, `third`, points to `NULL`, indicating the end of the list.
